Its expected that before read that you already read the previus section in the other folder
During my experts criations and with my interest in machine learning I thought about using neural networks to increase my performance.
Note: the code presented here was just the code that originated the results shoed on the thesis, much more test were performed during more than an year and the code was changing and some tests were just registed in my personal papers.
The diference that I brought to the markets was I'm trying to use it to increase strategies instead of trying to predict every movement.
I get good promissing results with simple strategies but I will not talk to much about here here beacuse you can read the thesis bellow.
To implement this in the market my next step is to create all in C++ and incorporate it with some brokers to backtest fast using just the resources I want and to run diferent test in parallel assecing only one time to the disk instead of doing it sequencial recurring to much to the disk.
I hope you find this so interesting as I did because it  bring me energy to work on it for close to 4 years now outside my university and job.
