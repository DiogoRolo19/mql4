I started my journey in the algorimtc trading in december 2020, I started by trying to implement the startegy that I manually used in the US30 lokking for mitigation of the price in imbalance zones,
That journey is showed on the 1-PriceAction
Before starting talking about my jouney I want to talk about mql4, its very close to C++, the main diference is that pointer are not allowed, but objects can still be passed as returns of functions.
In the next section I do something that is not usually from C++, I use the heads to implementthe real methods instead of only define them and then create a class to implement it.
I do that because in this specif case it allows me to work faster in this specific range. It also hard to handle that type of things in this language, at least it was my conclusion after my research.
Also using the headers as implementation classes when I compile I can only send 1 file to whatever I want to put helping me backtesting (Its happed few times)
So I started with simple scripts and as I'm getting more familliar with the language the code getts complexer.
My results of the 1 are very good for the complexity but it enter to less times in the market so I abandoned it.
Then In converse with one friend that have done this in the past he talks me about Mama incdicator, I find some indicator code on the web and learn how to import it and integrate it, I had great results on backtesting but with an enourmous risk.
It have big drawdowns and with this strategy I never could reduce the risk and manting the profit.
Then I talked with some friends that made money in trading and tried to implement their strategies in 3 (2 versions of it), 6 and 7.
That requires me a lot of coding skills and to learn much things and the harder part was translating what they want to code, now I feel that I really god at it.
In the last projects there is a lot of imports from the include library and the trading part of the code are in the indicators folder (inside the Include dir).
The project 5 was small tries to replacate online strategies and again to reduce the risk it was not profitable.
Im really proud of the last indicators, I did sometimes make money in the charts with some of theses but the market condition changed I that why it's so exciting to work on it.

FMCopy was a small script creating to replicate trades from 1 account to the others using text files. 
My goals was never High Frequency trading but the efeciency of the code to increase the backtesting speed was.

It was the funniest thing I done till now. It this that I love to do.
